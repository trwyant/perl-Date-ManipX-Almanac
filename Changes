    Parse civil, nautical, or astronomical twilight.

    Explicitly dispatch get_config to self or SUPER:: rather than doing
    it based on the contents of $attr->{config}{...}. This way I do not
    have to be so picky about how it gets initialized.

    Make error reporting more like Date::Manip.

    Add configuration for twilight.

    Delegate config file reading to tz object.  This means I call a
    public method rather than a private one to read the file. There is
    still an encapsulation violation, though, because the data go in a
    hash I do not own, with no assurance that there will not be future
    conflicts.

    Require Astro::Coord::ECI 0.119, for working clone().

    Install optional-module testing framework.

    Allow incidental words around star names.

    Add config() machinery for Astro::Coord::ECI::Star
