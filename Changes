    In English, add 'up' and 'down' as synonyms for 'rise' and 'set'.

    English did not parse twilight types at the beginning of twilight.
    That is "end of astronomical twilight" was parsed, but "beginning of
    astronomical twilight" was not. Fixed.

    In English, Allow (but ignore) "when" before bodies, as in "tomorrow
    when the sun rises"
