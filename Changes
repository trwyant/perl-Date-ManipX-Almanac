    Fix init error in Lang if location not set.  This really just gets
    us a Date::Manip-ish error when we attempt to parse a date, but this
    is better than an exception.

    Eliminate encapsulation violation setting language

    Clear language object when location is set.  This is because when
    the Lang object initializes itself it determines whether it is in
    the Northern or Southern hemisphere for seasonal reasons (things
    like whether the March equinox is Spring or Fall). We need to
    re-initialize this if the location changes, because we might have
    changed hemispheres.

    Make Date::ManipX::Almanac subclass of Date::Manip

    Parse civil, nautical, or astronomical twilight.

    Explicitly dispatch get_config to self or SUPER:: rather than doing
    it based on the contents of $attr->{config}{...}. This way I do not
    have to be so picky about how it gets initialized.

    Make error reporting more like Date::Manip.

    Add configuration for twilight.

    Delegate config file reading to tz object.  This means I call a
    public method rather than a private one to read the file. There is
    still an encapsulation violation, though, because the data go in a
    hash I do not own, with no assurance that there will not be future
    conflicts.

    Require Astro::Coord::ECI 0.119, for working clone().

    Install optional-module testing framework.

    Allow incidental words around star names.

    Add config() machinery for Astro::Coord::ECI::Star
